Just some info about pointers I understood while learning DS.

A imp thing to remember : a pointer is also a data type(don't forget it,very IMP) so it stores
address the same way as int x=5; stores its value.you think of pointer as different then other data types
remember it is not.It is very similar.

NULL pointer : Unless a value is assigned, a pointer will point to some garbage address by default.
Besides memory addresses,there is one additional value that a pointer can hold: a null value.
A null value is a special value that means the pointer is not pointing at anything. A pointer holding
a null value is called a null pointer.
